This is a full stack decentralized Raffle App using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Keepers, Solidity and Next.js from workshop from Chainlink Hackathon Spring 2022.

This repo contains all the stuff for the front-end part, the front-end is hold on [raffle-frontend](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-full-stack).

The workshop followed to complete this repo is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bMrko6iD9Q&t=5445s).

## Dependencies and Set-Up
- Create Next.js project:
```bash
yarn create next-app .
```

- Add Moralis web3uikit to interact with front-end:
```bash
yarn add moralis react-moralis web3uikit

```
- Add tailwindcss (CSS formarter):
```bash
yarn add --dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
or 
```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

- Initialize tailwindcss:
```bash
yarn tailwindcss init -p
```
or
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

- Override [tailwind.config.js](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-frontend/blob/main/tailwind.config.js) with the code inside this file.
- Override [global.css](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-frontend/blob/main/styles/globals.css)

- Run local yarn server:
```bash
yarn dev
```
You will have your local server running at: `http://localhost:3000`.

- Open new bash terminal to use while yarn server is running


## Export code
Once our Front-End code is finished..
1. Export our code to a Bundle.
2. Upload the Bundle to IPFs to be fully decentralized.

- Execute:
```bash
yarn next build
yarn next export
```
A file called `out` is going to be generated with our exported code.

## Upload to IPFS
We want our Front-End to be fully decentralized. To achive this goal we are uploading the `out` file to IPFS.
1. Open IPFS.
2. Go to Files.
3. Import `out` directory.
4. Click 'set pinning.

DONE! âœ… 

5. Copy CID.
6. Go to Browher and paste ipfs://CID.
